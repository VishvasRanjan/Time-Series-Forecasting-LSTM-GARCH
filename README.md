## Overview

This repository accompanies a detailed report (PDF) that builds a bridge from classical time‑series models (ARMA‑GARCH) to modern deep‑learning methods (LSTM) for forecasting:

- **Closing prices** of financial assets  
- **Volatility** of those assets  

We compare performance, highlight methodological synergies and divergences, and include full mathematical background, code snippets, and result discussions.
> **Note:** Code quality are being improved:— all codes attached in the pdf are executable. Separate Notebook will be provided asap!
